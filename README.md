# Female-Birth-Dorecasting-Using-Arima-Model
In this project i used previous 11 months data to forecast for Next 1 month for female birth forecasting.

In this Project I used Arima model for future forecasting of birth.

ARIMA :- ARIMA, short for ‘Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average’ is actually a class of models that ‘explains’ a given time series based on its own past values, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that equation can be used to forecast future values.
